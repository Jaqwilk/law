# CASE 1: THE UBER DRIVER'S STORY
## Employment vs. Independent Contractor

### The Story

**Characters:** James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam (Uber drivers in London)

**The Conflict:** James and Yaseen drove for Uber for years. Uber told them they were "partners" - independent businesspeople who could work whenever they wanted. But they noticed something strange:

- The Uber app tracked their every move
- Passengers rated them, and bad ratings could get them kicked off
- Uber set the prices - they couldn't charge more or less
- They never met the passengers who paid - Uber handled all the money
- Uber could terminate them anytime through the app

They thought: "If we're really our own bosses, why does Uber control everything?"

**The Battle:** James and Yaseen took Uber to the Employment Tribunal. Uber's lawyers argued: "These drivers are entrepreneurs! They choose their own hours! They're not employees!"

The drivers' lawyers countered: "Look at the reality. When James turns on his app in London, he's working FOR Uber. Uber controls the price, the customer relationship, and can fire him through an algorithm. That's not a partnership - that's employment."

**The Verdict:** The tribunal agreed with the drivers. They found:
- When drivers are in their territory with the app on = they are WORKING
- Even the drive home counts as work time
- Drivers are "WORKERS" (a UK category between employee and contractor)
- They deserve minimum wage and paid vacation

**The Lesson:**
> "The label on the contract doesn't matter - reality does. If you control someone like an employee, they ARE your employee."

**Legal Principle:** The substance of a relationship matters more than what parties call it. Control = employment.

**2024 Update:** The EU Directive 2024/2831 now creates a LEGAL PRESUMPTION that platform work is employment. Platforms must prove otherwise!

# CASE 2: THE BRITISH AIRWAYS LOYALTY TRAP
## Why Loyalty Rebates Can Be Abuse

### The Story

**Characters:** British Airways (BA), Travel Agents, Competitor Airlines

**The Setup:** British Airways dominated the UK airline market. They created a clever commission system for travel agents:

- If an agent sold MORE BA tickets than last year, they got a bonus
- But here's the trick: the bonus applied to ALL their BA sales, not just the extra ones
- So selling one more BA ticket could unlock huge bonuses on thousands of tickets

**The Trap:** Imagine Agent Sarah. Last year she sold 1,000 BA tickets. This year BA says: "Sell 1,001 tickets, and we'll increase your commission on ALL 1,001 tickets!"

Sarah does the math. That one extra ticket could be worth thousands of pounds in bonuses. If a competitor offers her a deal on a flight, she thinks: "Even if the competitor's price is better, selling that ticket means I lose my BA bonus on THOUSANDS of tickets."

She's trapped. She HAS to sell BA, even when it's not the best deal for customers.

**The Competitors' Problem:** Virgin Atlantic and other airlines approached Sarah: "We have great prices!" But Sarah told them: "I can't. Even your best deal can't make up for losing my BA bonuses."

The competitors would have to offer MASSIVE discounts to overcome BA's loyalty trap - discounts that would be financially impossible.

**The Case:** The European Commission investigated. BA argued: "We're rewarding loyalty! What's wrong with that?"

The Commission and courts said: "This isn't about rewarding loyalty. This is about TRAPPING agents so competitors can't reach customers. You're using your dominance to FORECLOSE the market."

**The Verdict:** ABUSE OF DOMINANT POSITION. BA was fined.

**The Lesson:**
> "Dominant companies can't create golden handcuffs that lock out competitors. Loyalty must come from being better, not from financial traps."

**Legal Principle:** Loyalty rebates that make it economically irrational for distributors to work with competitors constitute abuse of dominant position.

# CASE 3: GOOGLE'S SHOPPING SPREE
## Self-Preferencing and Market Power

### The Story

**Characters:** Google (search engine giant), Comparison Shopping Services (Kelkoo, Foundem, PriceGrabber), Online Shoppers

**The Scene:** It's 2008. You want to buy a new laptop. You go to Google and search "buy laptop cheap."

Before Google Shopping existed, you'd see results from various comparison shopping websites - Kelkoo, Foundem, PriceGrabber - sites that collected prices from many retailers to help you find the best deal.

**The Plot Twist:** Google launched Google Shopping. Suddenly, when you searched for products, you saw:
- A beautiful box at the TOP of results with Google Shopping listings
- Pictures, prices, stars - all for Google's service
- Those independent comparison sites? Pushed down to page 2, page 3, or invisible

**The Victims:** Adam Raff ran Foundem, a price comparison site. His traffic from Google COLLAPSED. "We went from thousands of visitors to almost none overnight," he said. "Not because we got worse, but because Google decided to promote itself."

**The Investigation:** The European Commission spent SEVEN YEARS investigating. They found:
- Google had 90%+ of the search market in Europe
- Google used special algorithms to DEMOTE competing shopping services
- Google Shopping got TOP placement with no objective reason
- Traffic to competitors dropped by 85% or more

**Google's Defense:** "We're just showing users what they want! Our shopping results are better!"

**The Commission's Response:** "You're using your dominance in search to CRUSH competition in shopping. That's LEVERAGING - using power in one market to dominate another."

**The Verdict:**
- ABUSE OF DOMINANT POSITION (Article 102 TFEU)
- Fine: €2.42 BILLION (one of the largest ever)
- Google must give equal treatment to competitors

**The Lesson:**
> "When you're dominant, you can't use that dominance to give yourself unfair advantages in other markets. Competition must be on the merits."

**Legal Principles:**
1. Self-preferencing by dominant companies is abuse
2. Leveraging dominance from one market to another is illegal
3. Algorithms can be tools of abuse

# CASE 4: THE WOOD PULP MYSTERY
## Cartel vs. Parallel Behavior

### The Story

**Characters:** Wood pulp producers from USA, Canada, Finland, Sweden (over 40 companies)

**The Suspicious Pattern:** In the 1970s-80s, European paper manufacturers noticed something odd. Every quarter, wood pulp prices from ALL major suppliers increased by almost exactly the same amount, at almost exactly the same time.

"It's too perfect," they thought. "These companies must be coordinating!"

**The Accusation:** The European Commission charged the wood pulp producers with running a CARTEL. Evidence:
- Prices moved in lockstep
- Announcements came at similar times
- Price increases were nearly identical

The Commission said: "This can't be coincidence. You must be communicating secretly!"

**The Defense:** The companies said: "We've never met! We've never agreed! The market just works this way!"

**The Investigation:** The court looked deeper. They found:
- The wood pulp market was highly TRANSPARENT
- Everyone could see everyone's prices immediately
- When one company raised prices, others naturally followed
- The cost structure was similar for everyone
- NO evidence of secret meetings or agreements

**The Verdict:** NOT A CARTEL. This was PARALLEL BEHAVIOR.

**The Key Finding:**
> "Parallel conduct cannot be regarded as furnishing proof of concertation unless concertation constitutes the ONLY PLAUSIBLE explanation."

In other words: If independent market behavior can explain the pattern, you can't assume there's a cartel.

**The Lesson:**
> "Looking the same doesn't mean acting together. In transparent markets, companies naturally react similarly to similar conditions."

**Legal Principles:**
1. CARTEL requires coordination (communication, agreement)
2. PARALLEL BEHAVIOR requires only market forces
3. The burden is on authorities to prove coordination
4. If there's another plausible explanation, it's not a cartel

# CASE 5: THE ETURAS DIGITAL CARTEL
## Yes, You Can Cartel Without Speaking

### The Story

**Characters:** 30 Lithuanian travel agencies, E-TURAS (an online booking system)

**The Setup:** E-TURAS was an online platform where travel agencies listed their tours. Agencies could offer discounts to attract customers - some offered 5%, others 10%, some up to 15%.

**The Message:** One day, a system administrator sent a message through the E-TURAS system: "Starting next week, the maximum discount will be limited to 3%."

The agencies didn't respond. They didn't write back. They didn't have a meeting. They just... said nothing.

The system was changed. Maximum discount: 3%. Prices effectively went up.

**The Investigation:** Lithuania's competition authority investigated. They found:
- 30 agencies saw the message
- None objected
- All accepted the new limit
- Consumers paid more

**The Defense:** "We never agreed to anything! We never met! We never even replied to the message!"

**The Legal Question:** Can you join a cartel by doing NOTHING?

**The Verdict:** YES. The European Court of Justice ruled:
- By not objecting and not distancing themselves, agencies tacitly consented
- Silence in response to a cartel invitation = participation
- Using the system after the change = participating in the restriction

**The Escape Clause:** The court said agencies could have avoided liability by:
- Publicly objecting
- Reporting to authorities
- Withdrawing from the system
- Clearly distancing themselves

**The Lesson:**
> "Silence is not always golden. In competition law, knowing about coordination and not objecting makes you a participant."

**Legal Principles:**
1. Cartels don't need written agreements
2. Cartels don't need meetings
3. Tacit acceptance through silence can constitute participation
4. You must ACTIVELY distance yourself from known anticompetitive behavior

# CASE 6: THE INFLUENCER DECEPTION
## UOKIK vs. Polish Influencers

### The Story

**Characters:** Polish fitness influencers, Olymp Laboratories (supplement company), Tomasz Chróstny (President of UOKIK - Polish competition authority)

**The Scheme:** Olymp Laboratories had a clever marketing idea. Instead of traditional advertising, they would pay popular fitness influencers to promote their supplements. But they told the influencers:

"Don't make it look like advertising. Use hashtags like #olimpad or just mention the product casually. Let your followers think you genuinely use and love our supplements."

**The Posts:** Influencers started posting:
- "My morning routine with my favorite protein!"
- "These supplements helped me get these gains! #olimpad #fit"
- Posts that looked like genuine recommendations, not paid advertising

**The Problem:** Polish consumers thought they were getting honest recommendations from people they trusted. They didn't know these were PAID ADVERTISEMENTS.

**The Investigation:** UOKIK investigated after receiving complaints. They found:
- Influencers were paid to promote products
- Disclosure was hidden or absent
- Tags like "#ad" were in English (Polish audience)
- Commercial nature was deliberately obscured
- Olymp Laboratories instructed influencers to be deceptive

**The Charges:**
1. **Hidden advertising** (crypto-advertising) - illegal
2. **Misleading consumers** - creating false impression of neutrality
3. **Unfair commercial practice** - exploiting trust

**The Defense:** Influencers said: "We were just following instructions!" Olymp said: "It was just marketing!"

**The Verdict:**
- BOTH influencers AND the company were liable
- Influencers cannot blindly follow instructions
- Fines: 139,000 PLN for influencers who didn't cooperate
- Warning: Future cases will face larger fines

**What UOKIK Said:**
> "#ad is not enough if your audience is Polish and doesn't understand English. Tags must be CLEAR, VISIBLE, and in the RIGHT LANGUAGE."

**Inadequate Disclosures:**
- #ad (English for Polish audience)
- #współpraca (cooperation - too vague)
- Tags at the END of posts
- Tags in small font or matching background color
- Tags hidden under "see more"

**The Lesson:**
> "Influencers are BUSINESSES. They must be registered, follow competition law, and clearly disclose when they're being paid. Trust cannot be monetized through deception."

**Legal Principles:**
1. Influencers are entrepreneurs subject to business law
2. Paid content must be CLEARLY disclosed
3. Both the influencer AND the paying company are liable
4. Disclosure must be in the audience's language
5. Disclosure must be prominent (beginning, not hidden)

# CASE 7: AMAZON'S LONG GAME
## The Chicago School Challenge

### The Story

**Characters:** Jeff Bezos (Amazon founder), Traditional retailers, Antitrust regulators, Lina Khan (law professor who wrote the famous article)

**The Strategy:** When Amazon started, Jeff Bezos had an unusual philosophy: "We're going to lose money. For years. On purpose."

Wall Street was confused. "Companies are supposed to make profit!"

Bezos responded: "We're investing in growth. Low prices now = market share = dominance later."

**The Numbers:**
- Amazon operated at a loss for its first 7 YEARS
- Investors kept funding them anyway
- They undercut competitors who couldn't match their prices
- Brick-and-mortar stores closed (Borders, Toys "R" Us)
- Eventually, Amazon became ESSENTIAL infrastructure

**The Paradox:** Traditional antitrust law (influenced by the Chicago School) says:
- Low prices = GOOD for consumers
- If consumers benefit, competition is working
- Predatory pricing is irrational - companies want profit

But Amazon challenged this logic:
- Low prices today, but what about tomorrow?
- When competitors are gone, who protects consumers?
- Is it "good competition" if it kills all competition?

**Lina Khan's Argument:** In her article "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," Khan argued:
1. Chicago School focuses too narrowly on PRICE
2. Amazon's strategy creates STRUCTURAL power
3. Amazon is now infrastructure competitors DEPEND on
4. Selling on Amazon while Amazon competes with you = conflict
5. Low prices today can mean monopoly prices tomorrow

**The Amazon Dilemma:**
- Amazon runs the marketplace AND sells on it
- Amazon sees all competitor data
- Amazon can copy successful products
- Sellers depend on Amazon but compete with it
- Is this a monopoly? Or just efficient business?

**Current Debates:**
- FTC lawsuits against Amazon
- EU Digital Markets Act targeting Amazon
- Calls for breaking up big tech
- Debate: Is the Chicago School outdated?

**The Lesson:**
> "Competition law focused only on price misses the bigger picture. Structural market power can harm competition even when prices are low."

**Legal Principles:**
1. Chicago School: Price is the main measure of competition
2. Challenge: Structure and market power matter too
3. Predatory strategies may not show up in traditional analysis
4. Platforms as infrastructure create new competition problems
5. Antitrust law is evolving to address digital markets

# CASE 8: THE RADBRUCH FORMULA
## When Law Violates Humanity

### The Story

**Characters:** Nazi soldiers, Holocaust victims, Post-war German courts, Gustav Radbruch (legal philosopher)

**The Dilemma:** After World War II, German courts faced an impossible question: How do you prosecute Nazi war criminals who claim "I was only following orders" and "Everything I did was legal under Nazi law"?

Technically, they were right. Nazi Germany had LAWS that authorized:
- Persecution of Jews
- The Holocaust
- Crimes against humanity

These weren't rogue actions - they were STATE POLICY, written into LEGAL CODES.

**The Legal Problem:** Under traditional legal positivism:
- Law is law, regardless of morality
- If it's validly enacted, it must be obeyed
- Judges apply the law, not their moral preferences

So could Nazi soldiers escape justice by saying "The law said I could do it"?

**Radbruch's Solution:** Gustav Radbruch, a German legal philosopher, provided the answer:

> "Where statutory law is incompatible with the requirements of justice to an INTOLERABLE DEGREE, the statute must yield to justice - it is to be considered 'false law' [unrichtiges Recht]."

And more specifically:

> "Where justice is not even AIMED at, where equality - the core of justice - is deliberately DENIED in the enactment of positive law, the statute is not merely 'false law', it FAILS to qualify as law at all."

**The Formula Applied:**
- Nazi racial laws deliberately denied human equality
- They didn't just fail to achieve justice - they aimed at INJUSTICE
- Therefore: Nazi racial laws were NEVER valid law
- "Following orders" based on these "laws" is no defense

**The Post-War Trials:** Using Radbruch's reasoning, courts held:
- Laws violating fundamental human dignity have no binding power
- Soldiers and officials cannot hide behind unjust laws
- There are limits beyond which positive law loses validity
- Natural justice provides a floor that no law can fall below

**The Lesson:**
> "Law without justice is not law. When a statute deliberately violates fundamental human dignity, it forfeits its claim to be obeyed."

**Legal Principles:**
1. There are moral limits to legal positivism
2. Laws deliberately denying human equality are void
3. "Following orders" doesn't excuse crimes against humanity
4. The Radbruch Formula: Extreme injustice is not law
5. This bridges natural law and positive law
