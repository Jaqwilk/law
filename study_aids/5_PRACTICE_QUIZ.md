3. State can intervene to correct market failures
4. Social safety net (healthcare, education, pensions)
5. Protection of workers' rights

3. **Social obligations** - minimum wage, labor protections, environmental standards
4. **Competition law** - state protects competition
5. **Consumer protection** - mandatory standards
6. **Taxation** - to fund social programs
7. **Regulation** - state can regulate for public interest

**Conclusion:** The state must balance economic freedom with social responsibility.

## Open Question 2
**Describe how Google abused its dominant position in the market of comparative shopping services.**

### Model Answer:

**Google's abuse included:**

1. **Self-preferencing:** Google promoted its own Google Shopping service prominently in search results, giving it an unfair advantage.

2. **Demoting competitors:** Google used its search algorithm to lower the ranking of competing comparison shopping services, reducing their visibility.

3. **Leveraging dominance:** Google used its dominant position in the search engine market (which it legitimately holds) to favor its own shopping service in a related market.

**Effects:**
- Reduced traffic to competing comparison shopping services
- Deprived consumers of genuine choice
- Stifled innovation in the comparison shopping market
- Created barriers to entry for new competitors

**Legal basis:** Article 102 TFEU - abuse of dominant position through discriminatory practices and leveraging dominance to a related market.

---

## Open Question 3
**What are the three elements of the relevant market in competition law? Give an example for each.**

### Model Answer:

**The three elements are:**

1. **PRODUCT MARKET**
   - Definition: Market where products are substitutes for each other
   - Criteria: Physical characteristics, function, price, consumer preferences
   - Example: In the United Brands case, the question was whether bananas constitute a separate market or are part of the general fruit market. The court found bananas are a separate market because they are available year-round and have unique characteristics.

2. **TERRITORIAL (GEOGRAPHIC) MARKET**
   - Definition: Area where conditions of competition are homogeneous
   - Criteria: Consumer habits, transportation costs, entry barriers
   - Example: For cement, the relevant market might be regional because transportation costs are high relative to product value, making it uneconomical to transport over long distances.

3. **TIME FRAMEWORK**
   - Definition: The period during which market conditions are assessed
   - Criteria: Seasonal variations, market fluctuations, economic crises
   - Example: For seasonal products like Christmas decorations, the relevant time period would be different from year-round products. Ice cream has different market conditions in summer vs. winter.

## Open Question 4
**What is a regulatory sandbox? What are the benefits for business and for regulators?**

### Model Answer:

**Definition:** A regulatory sandbox is a controlled framework set up by a competent authority that allows AI/technology providers to develop, train, validate, and test innovative systems in real-world conditions for a limited time under regulatory supervision.

**Benefits for BUSINESS:**
1. **Lower barriers to entry** - reduced initial compliance burden
2. **Reduced costs** - testing without full regulatory compliance
3. **Direct feedback from regulators** - understanding requirements early
4. **Path to authorization** - clear route to market
5. **Risk mitigation** - testing viability before full investment
6. **Competitive advantage** - first-mover opportunity

**Benefits for REGULATORS:**
1. **Better understanding** of new technologies
2. **Improved capacity** to adapt rules appropriately
3. **Evidence-based regulatory learning** - real data on innovation
4. **Early identification** of risks and problems
5. **Stakeholder engagement** - dialogue with industry
6. **Balanced regulation** - avoiding over- or under-regulation

**For CONSUMERS:** Access to potentially beneficial new services while still being protected during the testing phase.

## Open Question 5
**What is the difference in liability between a sole proprietorship and a joint-stock company? Explain the practical implications.**

### Model Answer:

**Sole Proprietorship:**
- **Liability:** UNLIMITED - the owner is personally liable for ALL business debts
- **No legal separation** between the owner and the business
- If the business fails, creditors can claim the owner's personal property (house, car, savings)
- The owner IS the business entity

**Joint-Stock Company (JSC):**
- **Liability:** LIMITED - shareholders are liable only up to the value of their shares
- **Legal separation** - the company is a separate legal person
- If the company fails, creditors can only claim company assets
- Shareholders can only lose their investment, not personal property
- The company (not shareholders) is the business entity

**Practical Implications:**

1. **Risk:** Sole proprietorship = higher personal risk; JSC = protected personal assets

2. **Investment:** JSC makes it easier to attract investors (limited risk)

3. **Capital:** JSC requires minimum 100,000 PLN capital; sole proprietorship has no minimum

4. **Complexity:** Sole proprietorship is simpler to establish and manage

5. **Credibility:** JSC may have more credibility with banks and partners

6. **Taxation:** Different tax treatments apply

7. **Decision-making:** Sole proprietor has full control; JSC requires corporate governance

**Recommendation:** For high-risk businesses or those needing external investment, a JSC is preferable. For simple, low-risk businesses, sole proprietorship may be sufficient.
