# 1. THE SYSTEM OF LAW

## 1.1 European (Continental) vs. English (Anglo-Saxon) Legal System

| Feature | Continental (Civil Law) | Anglo-Saxon (Common Law) |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Source of Law** | Codified statutes and codes | Case law (judicial precedents) |
| **Role of Judges** | Apply the law; decisions do NOT have the force of law | **Decisions made by judges HAVE THE VALUE OF LAW** (precedent/stare decisis) |
| **Legal Reasoning** | Deductive (from general rules to specific cases) | Inductive (from specific cases to general principles) |
| **Codification** | Comprehensive codes (Civil Code, Criminal Code) | Fragmented statutes supplemented by case law |
| **Influence** | Roman law tradition | English legal tradition |

**KEY EXAM POINT:** In the **Anglo-Saxon (Common Law) system**, decisions made by judges have the value of law through the doctrine of precedent (stare decisis).

---

## 1.2 Natural Law vs. Positive Law

### Natural Law
- Law of nature, God's law, customary law
- Rooted in morality; precedes human-made law
- Courts are NOT formally bound by it
- Based on inherent rules derived from nature and universal principles
- Discoverable through reason (not granted)
- Certain rights and ethical values are inherent in human nature

### Positive Law (Human-made Law)
- Law made by monarchs, parliaments ("statutory law"), governments, municipalities
- Includes domestic law, international agreements, law made by international organizations
- NOT necessarily based on morality/ethics (Exception: human rights)

**The Radbruch Formula:** A law that violates the fundamental human right to dignity has no binding power. This was used to prosecute WWII criminals who "only obeyed orders."

### Living Constitution vs. Original Intent

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Living Constitution** | Directs interpreters to derive the meaning of law from CURRENT circumstances |
| **Originalism** | Seeks to establish the ORIGINAL INTENT of the lawmakers (e.g., Justice Antonin Scalia) |

**KEY EXAM POINT:** The **living constitution** concept is the OPPOSITE of positive law interpretation (originalism). It allows courts to update the meaning of laws based on current circumstances.

---

## 1.3 Monist vs. Dualist Legal Systems

| System | Description | International Law Status |
|--------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Monist** | International and domestic law form ONE legal system | International law is automatically part of domestic law |
| **Dualist** | International and domestic law are SEPARATE systems | International law requires transformation into domestic law |

### Status in Polish Constitution
- Poland follows a **modified monist** approach
- International agreements ratified with parliamentary consent have **PRIORITY BEFORE STATUTES** (acts of Parliament)
- The Constitution itself remains supreme

---

## 1.4 French Law Influence

**French law influenced CONTRACT LAW (Private Law)** in Poland and many European countries, NOT public/administrative law.

This includes:
- Civil Code structure
- Contract formation rules
- Property law concepts

---

## 1.5 Non-Retroactivity of Law (Lex Retro Non Agit)

**"The law does not act retroactively"** means:
- A person cannot be punished for an act committed BEFORE the law was enacted
- New laws apply to future conduct, not past conduct
- This is a fundamental principle protecting legal certainty
- Exception: Laws that benefit the accused may sometimes apply retroactively

---

## 1.6 Legal vs. Factual Presumption

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Legal Presumption** | Required by LAW; shifts burden of proof | Polish family law presumes that if a woman gets pregnant within 300 days of divorce, her ex-husband is the father |
| **Factual Presumption** | Based on LOGIC and evidence | "Smoking gun" - evidence that leads to a logical conclusion |

Both can be **rebutted** by proof to the contrary.

---

## 1.7 Key Roman/Ancient Principles of Interpretation

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Lex superior derogat legi inferiori** | Higher-ranking law repeals lower-ranking law |
| **Lex posterior derogat priori** | Later law repeals earlier law |
| **Lex retro non agit** | Law does not act retroactively |
| **Nulla poena sine lege** | No punishment without law |
| **In dubio pro reo** | When in doubt, rule for the accused |
| **Ignorantia legis non excusat** | Ignorance of law is no excuse |
| **Res iudicata** | A matter already judged cannot be tried again |
| **Lex specialis derogat legi generali** | Specific law prevails over general law |
| **Pacta sunt servanda** | Agreements must be kept |

---

## 1.8 Interpretation Methods

### Civil Law Method vs. Administrative Law Method

| Method | Interpretation Allowed | Used In |
|--------|----------------------|---------|
| **Civil Law** | **EXPANSIVE** interpretation allowed | Contracts, private law (equality of parties) |
| **Administrative Law** | **RESTRICTIVE** interpretation only | Criminal law, tax law, administrative law (inequality - state vs. individual) |

**KEY EXAM POINT:** Civil law allows expansive interpretation; administrative law allows only restrictive interpretation.

---

# 2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - COPYRIGHT LAW

## 2.1 When is a Work "Established"?

A work is protected by copyright **since being established**, even if incomplete.

**Established** means the work has taken a **recognizable form** - for example:
- A bachelor thesis that is not finished but already has findings attributable to a concrete student
- A draft manuscript with identifiable creative content

**No formalities required** - the author is granted copyright protection regardless of whether formalities have been complied with.

---

## 2.2 Exhaustion of Rights (First Sale Doctrine)

**Definition:** A copyright owner's right to control copies of their work "exhausts" on its **FIRST SALE** by the copyright owner or with their consent.

**Consequences:**
- The copyright owner cannot oppose the use of products already placed on the market with their consent
- Cannot prevent resale of legitimately purchased items
- The purchaser has control over their copy, including the right to resell

---

## 2.3 Economic vs. Moral Rights

| Feature | Moral Rights | Economic Rights |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Duration** | **NO TIME LIMIT** (perpetual) | Life of author + 70 years |
| **Transferable?** | **NOT TRANSFERABLE** (inalienable) | Yes, can be sold, licensed, transferred |
| **Content** | Right to authorship, integrity of work, first publication | Right to use, reproduce, distribute, receive remuneration |
| **Protection after death** | Protected by successors and family | Transfer to heirs, then public domain |

**KEY EXAM POINT:** Moral rights are INALIENABLE (cannot be sold) and have NO TIME LIMIT.

---

## 2.4 Xerox Operators and Copyright

Xerox operators (anyone possessing reprographic devices conducting business in reproduction of works) must:
- Pay fees up to **3% of proceeds** to collective management organizations
- Proceeds distributed **50/50 between authors and publishers**

- Can make copies of **fragments** of disseminated works (NOT entire works)
- Libraries can provide free access to copies within their premises
- Can make copies to supplement, maintain, or protect collections

### Important Limitation:
**Even if a work is in the public domain, you are NOT free to use it without indicating the source!**
- Moral rights (including attribution) persist even after economic rights expire
- You must still credit the author

### Permitted Uses (Article 23-35):
- Personal use (including by family)
- Quotations for explanation, critical analysis, teaching
- Parody, pastiche, caricature
- Works on public roads/squares (but not for same use)

1. **The author** (the person who wrote the letter) - for copyright
2. **The recipient** - for privacy rights
3. If the author is deceased - their heirs or estate

The letter is protected both by:
- Copyright law (creative expression)
- Privacy/personality rights (personal correspondence)

---

# 3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY

## 3.1 Duration of Protection

| **Utility Model** | **10 years** from filing date |

---

## 3.2 Geographical Indications (Champagne Example)

**Can a Spanish producer of sparkling wine use the name "Champagne"?**

**NO.** Champagne is a **protected geographical indication** (GI) that can only be used for sparkling wine produced in the Champagne region of France using specific methods.

- Geographical indications protect regional products
- "Champagne" indicates both origin and quality standards
- Spanish sparkling wine must use other names (e.g., "Cava")

---

## 3.3 Patent Novelty Standard

**To be "new," a patent must not be state of the art to whom?**

A patent must not be state of the art to **AN EXPERT** (person skilled in the art), NOT an ordinary person.

The standard is:
- **Technical expert** in the relevant field
- What would be obvious to someone with expertise
- Based on publicly available prior art worldwide

---

## 3.4 Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC)

**What is SPC?**

An SPC is an intellectual property right that extends the duration of a patent right for:
- **Pharmaceutical products**
- **Plant protection products**

**Purpose:** Compensates for the time lost during regulatory approval (clinical trials, marketing authorization). Can extend protection for up to **5 additional years**.

---

## 3.5 Abuse of Patent

**What is abuse of a patent?**

Patent abuse includes:
- Refusing to license on reasonable terms when the patent is essential
- Using patent to extend monopoly beyond legitimate scope
- Tying arrangements
- Price fixing through patent pools

**What can be done about it?**

|--------|-----------------|
| **Coat hanger** | Industrial design (aesthetic appearance) or utility model (functional improvement) |
| **Jar** | Industrial design (shape/appearance) or trademark (distinctive shape) |
| **Bicycle seat** | Industrial design, utility model, or patent (if innovative) |

---

# 4. COMPETITION LAW - CARTELS

## 4.1 What is a Cartel?

A **cartel** is an agreement between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings, or concerted practices that:
- May affect trade between Member States
- Have as their **object or effect** the prevention, restriction, or distortion of competition

**Legal basis:** Article 101 TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union)

---

## 4.2 Forms of Cartels

Cartels can take many forms:

1. **Written agreements**
2. **Oral agreements**
3. **Informal statements** coordinating business actions
4. **Concerted practices** (coordination without formal agreement)
5. **Exchange of information** (about clients, prices, etc.)
6. **Decisions of trade associations** (rules, regulations)

**Can you enter into a cartel without saying or writing anything?**

**YES!** Through:
- **Concerted practices** - coordination through market signals
- **Tacit collusion** - understanding without explicit communication
- **Information exchange** - sharing sensitive business data
- **Algorithmic coordination** - using algorithms that lead to price alignment

**ETURAS Case Example:** Travel agencies coordinated discounts through an online booking system without direct communication - this was found to be a cartel.

---

## 4.3 Types of Prohibited Agreements (Article 101 TFEU)

1. **Price fixing** - directly or indirectly fixing purchase or selling prices
2. **Output limitations** - limiting production, markets, technical development
3. **Market sharing** - dividing markets or sources of supply
4. **Discriminatory conditions** - applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions
5. **Tied transactions** - making contracts subject to unrelated supplementary obligations

---

## 4.4 Cartel vs. Parallel Behavior

| Feature | Cartel | Parallel Behavior |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **Definition** | Coordinated action through agreement | Independent decisions leading to similar outcomes |
| **Cause** | Communication/coordination between competitors | Market transparency, similar cost structures |
| **Legal status** | **PROHIBITED** | **LEGAL** |
| **Example** | Competitors agree to raise prices | All companies raise prices because raw materials cost more |

**KEY EXAM POINT:** Parallel behavior resulting from market conditions is NOT a cartel (Wood Pulp II case, 1993).

**Burden of proof:** The **accused enterprise** must prove parallel behavior (reversal of general principle).

---

## 4.5 Selective Distribution Agreements

### What is Selective Distribution?
A system where the supplier selects distributors based on specific criteria and distributors agree not to sell to unauthorized dealers.

### When Can It Become a Cartel?
- When it aims to fix prices uniformly
- When criteria are used to exclude competitors
- When it restricts online sales without justification

### When is it NOT a Cartel?
1. **Goods need specialized service** (watches, electronics)
2. **Luxury goods** requiring brand image protection (cosmetics, jewelry)
3. **Admission criteria are**:
   - Open and transparent
   - Non-discriminatory
   - Objective (technical backup, display standards)

2. Allows consumers a fair share of the benefit
3. Does not impose restrictions beyond what is necessary
4. Does not eliminate competition for a substantial part of products

---

# 5. COMPETITION LAW - ABUSE OF DOMINANT POSITION

## 5.1 Is Having a Dominant Position Prohibited?

**NO!** Having a dominant position is **NOT prohibited**.

Only the **ABUSE** of a dominant position is prohibited under Article 102 TFEU.

However, dominant companies have a **"special responsibility"** - their mere presence weakens competition, so they must be extra careful.

---

## 5.2 Definition of Dominant Position

**Hoffman-La Roche definition (Case 85/76):**

"A position of economic strength enjoyed by an undertaking which enables it to **prevent effective competition** being maintained on the relevant market by affording it the power to behave to an appreciable extent **independently** of its competitors, its customers, and ultimately of the consumers."

---

## 5.3 How is Dominance Measured?

**Market share thresholds:**
- **> 40% market share** creates a **PRESUMPTION** of dominance (not certainty!)
- Actual research of market forces must be conducted
- Must analyze structure, entry barriers, technology, vertical integration

**Sources of dominance:**
- Technology advantages
- Entry barriers
- Vertical integration
- Access to raw materials
- High cost of market entry

**Can a small company be dominant?**
**YES!** In a niche or specialized market where it has significant market power, even a small company can be dominant.

---

## 5.4 The Three Elements of the Relevant Market

1. **Product Market**
   - Products that are **substitutes** for each other
   - Based on: physical characteristics, function, price, consumer preferences
   - Example: Are bananas substitutes for other fruits? (United Brands case)

2. **Territorial/Geographic Market**
   - Area where conditions of competition are **homogeneous**
   - Criteria: consumer habits, transportation costs, entry barriers

3. **Time Framework**
   - Seasonal variations
   - Rise and fall of markets
   - Supply/demand fluctuations
   - Economic crises

---

## 5.5 What is Abuse of Dominant Position? (Examples)

**Definition:** Having an impact on market structure by hindering existing competition or growth of competition.

**Examples of Abuse:**

1. **Unfair pricing** - Imposing unfair purchase/selling prices
2. **Limiting production** - To prejudice consumers
3. **Discriminatory conditions** - Different terms for equivalent transactions
4. **Tied transactions** - Requiring unrelated purchases (Microsoft + Internet Explorer)
5. **Loyalty rebates** - Rewarding exclusivity to foreclose competitors (British Airways case)
6. **Refusal to deal** - Especially with essential facilities
7. **Predatory pricing** - Below-cost pricing to eliminate competitors

---

## 5.6 Loyalty Rebates (British Airways Case)

**Why are certain loyalty rebates prohibited?**

British Airways case (T-219/99):
- BA offered rebates where meeting sales-growth targets increased commission on **ALL tickets**, not just those above the target
- This created strong incentive to sell only BA tickets
- Competitors had to offer much higher commissions to overcome this effect
- Result: Agents had no incentive to sell competitor tickets

**Prohibited because:**
- Forecloses competitors from the market
- Creates artificial loyalty not based on product quality
- Prevents customers from switching to competitors

---

## 5.7 Google Shopping Case

**How did Google abuse its dominant position?**

Google abused its dominant position in the market of **comparative shopping services** by:
1. **Self-preferencing** - Promoting its own Google Shopping service in search results
2. **Demoting competitors** - Using algorithms to lower ranking of competing shopping services
3. **Leveraging dominance** - Using search engine dominance to favor its shopping service

The Commission found this:
- Reduced traffic to competing comparison shopping services
- Deprived consumers of genuine choice
- Stifled innovation

---

## 5.8 Essential Facilities

**What is an essential facility?**

An infrastructure or resource that is:
- Controlled by a dominant company
- Essential for competitors to operate in the market
- Not economically feasible to duplicate

**Examples:**
- Ports and harbors
- Railway networks
- Telecommunications infrastructure
- Airport slots
- Energy distribution networks

**Essential Facilities Doctrine:** Dominant companies may be required to provide access to essential facilities on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms.

---

## 5.9 Mergers and Competition

**Why can mergers pose a threat to competition?**
- Can create or strengthen dominant positions
- Reduce number of competitors
- Increase market concentration
- May lead to higher prices and less innovation

**What enterprises do NOT have to notify the antimonopoly authority?**

Small mergers below thresholds:
- EU: Combined worldwide turnover < €5 billion AND EU-wide turnover of each party < €250 million
- National thresholds vary by country
- Mergers with no EU dimension handled by national authorities

---

# 6. THE AMAZON CASE & CHICAGO SCHOOL

## 6.1 The Chicago School of Economics - Central Claim

**The central claim of the Chicago School:**

"The proper lens for viewing antitrust problems is **PRICE THEORY**."

**Key principles:**
1. **Consumer welfare** is the sole goal of antitrust law
2. **Low prices** alone are evidence of sound competition
3. **Predatory pricing** is irrational because firms prioritize profits
4. **Vertical integration** is generally efficient, not harmful
5. **Entry barriers** from economies of scale are just "objective technical demands"
6. Markets are efficient; rational actors seek to maximize profits

**Criticism of the Chicago School:**

The Amazon article argues that the Chicago School approach:
- Fails to capture how modern platforms gain and use dominance
- Focuses too narrowly on short-term consumer prices
- Ignores structural market power
- Allows predatory strategies that don't trigger traditional antitrust scrutiny

---

## 6.2 Amazon's Business Strategy

**Two key elements:**
1. **Willingness to sustain losses** - Prioritizing growth over profits
2. **Integration across multiple business lines** - Becoming essential infrastructure

**Why this matters:**
- Amazon reported losses for first 7 years
- Prioritized market share over profits
- Created Amazon Prime to lock in customers
- Became infrastructure provider to competitors
- Competitors depend on Amazon while competing with it

---

# 7. UNFAIR COMPETITION AND INFLUENCERS

| Location | Rule |
|----------|------|
| **Workplace or Classroom** | **PROHIBITED** (except for medical or safety reasons) |
| **Other places** | **HIGH-RISK** - allowed with additional precautions |

**Rationale:** Special protection in workplaces and schools because:

---

## 10.2 Sole Proprietorship vs. Joint-Stock Company - Liability

| Feature | Sole Proprietorship | Joint-Stock Company |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Legal separation** | NO - owner and business are same entity | YES - company is separate legal person |
