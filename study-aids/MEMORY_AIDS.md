# Memory Aids, Mnemonics & Tricks

## How Memory Works for Law
The best way to remember legal concepts is to:
1. **Connect** new info to what you already know
2. **Visualize** abstract concepts
3. **Use acronyms** for lists
4. **Create stories** linking concepts
5. **Practice retrieval** (test yourself!)

## 1. Legal Systems

### Common Law vs Civil Law
**"The JUDGE Creates Common law, the CODE Controls Civil law"**

| Common Law | Civil Law |
|------------|-----------|
| **J**udges make law | **C**odes contain law |
| **U**K origin | **C**ontinent origin |
| **D**ecisions bind | **O**rdained statutes |
| **G**radual development | **D**efined in advance |
| **E**volves case by case | **E**nacted wholesale |

### The JJ Rule
**"Justinian's Justice became Civil, England's Evolved into Common"**
- Justinian (6th century) = Civil Law foundation
- England (post-1066) = Common Law foundation

### Historical Timeline Visual
```
529 CE -----> 1066 -----> 1215 -----> 1765 -----> 1804
Justinian     Norman      Magna       Blackstone   Napoleon
  |           Conquest    Carta                    Code
  v             v           v             v          v
CIVIL LAW    COMMON LAW   Rights      Treatise   CIVIL CODE
BORN         BORN         Trial                   MODEL
```

## 2. EU Law Hierarchy

### The "RDD" Pyramid for Secondary Law

**"Regulations are ROCKETS - they Directly Deploy"**
- Blast straight into national law
- No assembly required
- Immediate effect

**"Directives are DESTINATIONS - member states choose the route"**
- Binding goal
- National implementation choice
- Deadline to arrive

**"Decisions are DARTS - they hit specific targets"**
- Binding on addressee only
- Precise aim
- Immediate effect

### Visual Memory Aid
```
         EU Secondary Law
              /|\
             / | \
            /  |  \
    REGULATIONS | DECISIONS
    (Everywhere) | (Targeted)
                 |
            DIRECTIVES
         (Goals + Deadline)
```

### The PLEF Principles
General Principles of EU Law:
- **P**roportionality
- **L**egal certainty
- **E**qual treatment
- **F**undamental rights
- (+ Legitimate Expectations)

**Story**: "A PLEF judge always balances (Proportionality), speaks clearly (Legal certainty), treats all fairly (Equal treatment), and respects dignity (Fundamental rights)."

## 3. Competition Law

### Article 101: POMBI Violations
**P**rice fixing
**O**utput limitation
**M**arket sharing
**B**id rigging
**I**nformation exchange

**Memory Story**: "The POMBI gang met secretly to fix Prices, limit Output, share Markets, rig Bids, and exchange Information."

### Article 102: The "EMPEROR" Test
Is there **dominance**? (The Emperor's power)
Is there **abuse**? (The Emperor's tyranny)

### Types of Abuse: "PREMISE"
**P**redatory pricing
**R**efusal to deal
**E**xcessive pricing
**M**argin squeeze
**I**nformation manipulation
**S**elling conditions (unfair)
**E**xclusive dealing

**Memory Story**: "The dominant company operated on a false PREMISE that it could abuse its power."

### Market Share Rule of Thumb
```
Below 25%  = Generally safe
25-40%    = Possible dominance
40%+      = Presumed dominance
70%+      = Almost certainly dominant
```

**"25 is fine, 40 is danger time, 70 is clearly a crime"**

## 4. Intellectual Property

### Copyright: What's Protected
**"CLAMPS"** - Copyright protects:
- **C**omputer software
- **L**iterary works
- **A**rtistic works
- **M**usical compositions
- **P**hotographs/films
- **S**cientific works

### Copyright vs NOT Copyright
**Copyright**: The WAY you say it (expression)
**NOT Copyright**: WHAT you say (idea)

**"I can write my OWN book about a boy wizard at magic school, but I can't copy Harry Potter's words"**

### Duration Memory Trick
**"Life + 70 = EU Copyright"**

Imagine the author living their full LIFE, then their work is protected for another **70 YEARS** - basically protecting their grandchildren's generation.

### Rights Types: "EM"
- **E**conomic rights = Money (transferable)
- **M**oral rights = Me (usually non-transferable)

### Economic Rights: "ALARM"
- **A**daptation
- **L**icensing/distribution
- **A**uthorizing reproduction
- **R**ecording/fixation
- **M**aking available to public

## 5. Digital Regulation (DSA & AI Act)

### DSA: The "PARTS" Framework for VLOPs
**P**rofiling ads to minors banned
**A**ssessments (annual risk)
**R**eporting transparency
**T**rusted flaggers system
**S**ystemic risk mitigation

### The 6% Rule
**"Six percent can really hurt"**
Maximum DSA fine = 6% of global annual turnover

### VLOP Threshold
**"45 Million = Very Large"**
45M+ monthly active EU users = VLOP status

### AI Act Risk Levels: The Traffic Light+
```
RED LIGHT (STOP)     = Unacceptable Risk (Banned)
AMBER (CAUTION)      = High Risk (Strict rules)
YELLOW (WATCH)       = Limited Risk (Transparency)
GREEN (GO)           = Minimal Risk (Free use)
```

**Examples by light**:
- RED: Social scoring, manipulating vulnerable people
- AMBER: Medical devices, HR recruitment tools
- YELLOW: Chatbots, deep fakes
- GREEN: Games, spam filters

### AI Sandbox Visual
Imagine a **children's sandbox** where:
- You can **experiment** freely (innovation)
- Adults **watch** (regulatory supervision)
- If you cause harm, you're **pulled out** (compliance)
- You learn the rules **before going to the real playground** (market)

## 6. Business Structures

### JSC Features: "SLIM PT"
**S**hares (capital divided into)
**L**imited liability
**I**ncorporated (legal personality)
**M**anagement (professional board)

**P**ublic trading possible
**T**ransferable shares

### Uber Issues: "LE" Questions
**L**abor: Employee or contractor?
**E**ntry: Transport or tech service?

## 7. Exam-Day Quick Recall

### IRAC Method
**I** spotted an **I**ssue
**R**ead the **R**ule that applies
**A**pplied it to the **A**ctual facts
**C**oncluded with a clear **C**onclusion

### Key Articles Number Memory

| Number | What It's About | Memory Trick |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| 101 | Anticompetitive agreements | "101 Dalmatians all agreeing = cartel!" |
| 102 | Abuse of dominance | "102 = 101 + 1 = going beyond fair dealing" |
| 258 | Infringement proceedings | "2-5-8 = Commission comes after you late" |
| 267 | Preliminary references | "267 = Courts call the ECJ hotline" |
