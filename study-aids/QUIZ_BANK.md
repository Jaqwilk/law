### Short Answer (5 points each)

**6. Compare the role of judges in common law vs civil law systems.**

<details>
<summary>Model Answer</summary>

In **common law**: Judges have a significant law-making role. They interpret existing precedents and their decisions become binding on future cases. Judges shape the law through the adversarial process.

In **civil law**: Judges primarily apply pre-existing codified rules to facts. Their role is to find and apply the relevant code provisions. While their decisions are persuasive, they don't create binding precedent in the same way.

<details>
<summary>Model Answer</summary>

Blackstone's Commentaries (1765-1769) was the first comprehensive, systematic treatise on English common law. It was accessible to laypeople and became foundational for American law.

- A) A single dominant company
- B) Government price controls
- C) Secret agreements between competitors
- D) Vertical agreements with suppliers

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
C) Secret agreements between competitors (horizontal collusion)
</details>

---

### Short Answer (5 points each)

**6. What is "margin squeezing" and why is it anticompetitive?**

<details>
<summary>Model Answer</summary>

Margin squeezing occurs when a vertically integrated dominant company:
- Charges a high price for an input it supplies to competitors
- While charging a low price for the final product

This "squeezes" competitors' profit margins, making it impossible for them to compete profitably in the downstream market. It's anticompetitive because it leverages dominance in one market to exclude competitors from another, without competing on the merits.
</details>

---

**7. How do algorithms create new challenges for cartel enforcement?**

<details>
<summary>Model Answer</summary>

Algorithms create challenges because:
1. **Automated price coordination**: Pricing algorithms can monitor and match competitors' prices automatically, facilitating tacit collusion without explicit agreement
2. **Hub-and-spoke through platforms**: Platform algorithms can coordinate prices among sellers without direct communication
3. **Speed**: Algorithmic adjustments happen too fast for traditional monitoring
4. **Evidence**: No paper trail or explicit communications to prove collusion
5. **Intent questions**: Unclear if the algorithm designer intended anticompetitive outcomes
</details>

### Problem Question (10 points)

**8. TechGiant Co. holds 65% of the cloud computing market. It requires all customers to also use its email service (bundled pricing) and offers the cloud service at a price below its own costs to new customers for the first year. Analyze potential Article 102 issues.**

<details>
<summary>Model Answer</summary>

**Issue 1: Dominance**
- 65% market share creates a strong presumption of dominance
- Cloud computing market appears to be properly defined
- TechGiant is likely dominant under Article 102

**Issue 2: Tying/Bundling**
- Requiring email service with cloud service = tying
- Links two separate products
- Forces customers to take unwanted product
- May foreclose competitors in email market
- Likely abuse if no objective justification

**Issue 3: Predatory Pricing**
- Pricing below cost to new customers
- Dominant firms cannot use below-cost pricing to eliminate competitors
- Must assess if prices are below average variable cost (presumed predatory) or between AVC and ATC (predatory if intent to eliminate shown)
- One-year promotion may indicate strategy to lock in customers

**Conclusion:**
Both practices likely constitute abuse of dominant position under Article 102. The tying forecloses competition in the email market while leveraging cloud dominance. The below-cost pricing appears designed to eliminate competitors rather than compete on merits.

**6. What is the "public domain" and how can a work enter it?**

<details>

### Short Answer (5 points each)

**6. What are "dark patterns" and how does the DSA address them?**

<details>
<summary>Model Answer</summary>

**Dark patterns** are deceptive interface designs that manipulate users into:
- Making unintended purchases
- Sharing more personal data than intended
- Making it difficult to cancel subscriptions
- Consenting to things they wouldn't otherwise agree to

The DSA **prohibits** dark patterns on online platforms. This means platforms cannot use interface designs that deceive or manipulate users into decisions that serve the platform's interests against the user's wishes. Examples of banned practices include hidden costs, forced continuity, and misdirection.
</details>

---

**7. Explain the AI Act's risk-based approach.**

<details>
<summary>Model Answer</summary>

The AI Act categorizes AI systems by risk level with corresponding rules:

1. **Unacceptable Risk (Banned):**
   - Social scoring by governments
   - Manipulation of vulnerable groups
   - Real-time biometric identification in public (with exceptions)

2. **High Risk (Strict requirements):**
   - Medical devices, recruitment tools, law enforcement
   - Must meet requirements for data quality, documentation, human oversight
   - Subject to conformity assessments

3. **Limited Risk (Transparency):**
   - Chatbots, emotion recognition, deep fakes
   - Must inform users they're interacting with AI

4. **Minimal Risk (Free use):**
   - AI-enabled games, spam filters
   - No specific requirements
</details>

---

**8. What is an AI sandbox and why is it beneficial?**

<details>
<summary>Model Answer</summary>

An **AI sandbox** is a controlled regulatory environment that allows companies to test AI innovations under regulatory supervision before full market deployment.

Benefits:
- **For innovators**: Test new technologies without full compliance burden initially
- **For regulators**: Learn about new technologies and their risks firsthand
- **For society**: Ensures AI innovation happens safely
- **For the market**: Reduces uncertainty about regulatory requirements
- **For compliance**: Companies can get guidance before major investment

The sandbox creates a "learning by doing" approach where regulators and companies cooperate rather than companies just receiving rules after the fact.

### Essay Question (20 points)

**Write a comprehensive answer analyzing the following scenario:**

StartUp Inc. has developed an AI-powered recruitment tool that screens job applications. The company is based in Germany and wants to offer this service to businesses across the EU. The AI uses applicant data including social media profiles to make hiring recommendations.

**Address the following:**
a) What regulatory frameworks apply?
b) Under which AI Act risk category does this fall?
c) What compliance obligations exist?
d) What copyright/data issues might arise?

<details>
<summary>Model Answer</summary>

**a) Applicable Regulatory Frameworks:**
- **AI Act**: Directly governs AI-powered recruitment tools
- **GDPR**: Governs personal data processing (applicant information)
- **DSA**: If operating as an online platform (possibly)
- **National employment law**: May have additional restrictions on automated decision-making in hiring

**b) AI Act Risk Category:**
This is a **High-Risk AI system** under the AI Act because recruitment/HR is explicitly listed as high-risk. AI systems used to screen or filter job applications fall under Annex III.

**c) Compliance Obligations:**
Under AI Act high-risk requirements:
- Risk management system implementation
- Data governance (training data must be relevant, representative, free from bias)
- Technical documentation
- Record-keeping/logging
- Transparency to users
- Human oversight mechanisms
- Accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity

Under GDPR:
- Legal basis for processing (likely legitimate interest or consent)
- Data minimization
- Right to explanation for automated decisions (Art. 22)
- Data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure)
- Potentially Data Protection Impact Assessment

**d) Copyright/Data Issues:**
- **Copyright**: If the AI analyzes/processes copyrighted content from social media profiles, may need licensing or rely on exceptions
- **Database rights**: Aggregating data may create database requiring IP consideration
- **Social media data**: TOS of social platforms may prohibit scraping
- **Training data**: Must ensure training data was lawfully obtained
- **Applicant data**: Processing social media data raises significant privacy concerns - need clear legal basis and transparency
- **Profiling**: Making recommendations based on inferred characteristics could be discriminatory

**Conclusion:**
StartUp Inc. faces significant regulatory hurdles. The high-risk classification under AI Act requires substantial compliance investment. The company should conduct a thorough legal assessment, implement required safeguards, and may need to redesign aspects of the tool (especially regarding social media data usage) before EU-wide deployment.
