## 1. Legal Systems & Foundations

### Common Law vs Civil Law - The Two Traditions

| Aspect | Common Law | Civil Law |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Origin** | England (Middle Ages) | Continental Europe (Roman law) |
| **Basis** | Judicial decisions (precedent) | Codified statutes |
| **Code** | Uncodified | Comprehensive legal codes |
| **Judge's Role** | Shapes law through decisions | Applies existing code |
| **System Type** | Adversarial | Inquisitorial |
| **Key Document** | Magna Carta (1215) | Corpus Iuris Civilis (6th c.) |

**Memory Hook: "Common = Courts Create, Civil = Codes Control"**

### Key Historical Milestones
- **529 CE**: Emperor Justinian's Corpus Iuris Civilis
- **1066**: Norman Conquest (centralizing English law)
- **1215**: Magna Carta
- **1765-1769**: Blackstone's Commentaries
- **1804**: Napoleonic Code

### Important Terms
- **Precedent**: Prior judicial decisions binding on future cases
- **Stare Decisis**: "Stand by decided matters" - follow precedent
- **Habeas Corpus**: Protection against unlawful detention
- **Equity**: Principles supplementing strict common law
- **Writ**: Royal/judicial order directing legal action

## 2. EU Law Sources & Hierarchy

### Hierarchy of EU Law (Top to Bottom)

```
         INTERNATIONAL LAW
              (Treaties)
                  |
         PRIMARY EU LAW
    (TEU, TFEU, EU Charter)
                  |
         SECONDARY EU LAW
    (Regulations, Directives, Decisions)
                  |
         SOFT LAW
    (Recommendations, Guidelines)
```

### Secondary Law - The "RDD" Framework

| Type | Binding? | Direct Effect | Transposition Needed? |
|------|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **R**egulations | Yes - entirely | Yes - immediate | No |
| **D**irectives | Yes - results only | Conditional | Yes - by member states |
| **D**ecisions | Yes - specific parties | Yes | No |

**Memory Hook: "RDD = Regulations Directly Deploy, Directives Demand Domestic action, Decisions Direct specific parties"**

### Key Characteristics

**Regulations:**
- Binding in entirety
- Directly applicable
- Self-executing
- Example: EU Merger Control Regulation

**Directives:**
- Binding as to results
- Member states choose implementation method
- Must be transposed into national law
- Commission can sue states for non-transposition (Art. 258 TFEU)

**Decisions:**
- Binding on those addressed
- Can target individuals, companies, or states
- Example: Competition law fines

### General Principles of EU Law
1. **Proportionality** - measures must be appropriate and necessary
2. **Legal Certainty** - laws must be clear and predictable
3. **Equal Treatment** - no discrimination
4. **Legitimate Expectations** - protect reasonable reliance
5. **Fundamental Rights** - respect human rights
